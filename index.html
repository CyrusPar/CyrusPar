                        I am Cyrus Gello M. Par, an undergraduate programmer currently studying at the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os. I am 20 years old, 
                        born on January 23, 2004, and originally from the Province of Marinduque. I began my studies at the University in 2022 after securing a position as
                         a Computer Science student. I graduated from Marinduque National High School with High Honors.
                         <br><br>
                        Throughout my academic journey, I have developed numerous projects, demonstrating proficiency and knowledge in a variety of programming languages. 
                        My goal is to complete my studies and pursue a career as a Software Engineer or Data Scientist, leveraging my diverse skills and experiences to contribute 
                        effectively to a company.

                                    My initial official project developed using Java is titled <strong>Cycraft Invasion</strong>. Inspired by the popular game 
                                    <em>Minecraft</em> created by Mojang, this project involved creating a 2D shooting game that emulates combat scenarios and 
                                    interactions with creatures similar to those in <em>Minecraft</em>. The development process emphasized the application of Object-Oriented
                                     Programming principles and included the integration of visual and audio components through Java. This project allowed me to apply and 
                                     expand my programming skills in a practical context, showcasing the effectiveness of Java for game development and object-oriented design.

                                    My first programming project was a game designed to enhance memorization skills while efficiently storing user scores. 
                                    The game incorporated automatic logic implementation for randomization. Developed using Python, it operates within a 
                                    terminal environment and is compatible with any operating system. The game offers multiple difficulty levels, tracks 
                                    user scores, and maintains leaderboards. The project required the use of various Python syntax and libraries to successfully 
                                    implement the intended functionalities.

                                    My first mobile application was a group project, in collaboration with three students, where I contributed as a front-end developer.
                                    The project, titled Elbi Donation System, enables users to log in as either donors or organizations. The application was designed 
                                    with user-friendly layouts to facilitate easy navigation. It incorporates Firebase for data storage, ensuring that all user inputs 
                                    are securely saved and accessible for public use. Additionally, the project addressed authentication and security measures to protect
                                    user privacy and prevent data leakage. The application was developed using Dart and Android Studio during my sophomore year.

                                    A mathematical program developed using the R language, titled Numerical and Symbolic Computation, features a user interface for

                                    Regression. Both solvers return the function and estimated values based on provided inputs. Additionally, the project includes a 
                                    Simplex implementation for the Diet Problem Solver, which considers a person‚Äôs nutritional requirements and a menu of available foods. 
                                    The program determines the optimal food selection while minimizing cost and meeting nutritional needs. This project emphasizes 
                                    computational problem solving, sources of computational errors, iterative approximation methods, and symbolic algebra.
